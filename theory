Introduction:-
1.	What is cloud computing ?
The cloud computing is the computing services to using that storage ,databases, networking , software ,analysting the data by using internet this is payable condition

2.	Deployment Model in Cloud ?
There are four type of deployment model in cloud 
        1 public cloud – this computing services is provided to third party by using public internet and they have provides a many services    example---- AWS , Azure
        2 private cloud – this is set by only one organization for self use 
         3 Hybrid cloud – the organization can be use own services as well as public services    


3.	Service Model in Cloud ?
 There are 5 type of service model
•	Infrastructure as a service ( IAAS)
•	Platform as a service ( PAAS )
•	Software as a service ( SAAS )
•	Anything as a service ( AAAS )
•	Function as a service ( FAAS ) 


4.	Architecture of Cloud Computing ?
             The services are 3 types 
                    1)  Infrastructure as a Service    IAAS -    This serves can be use only hardware setup   and using only infrastructure they have use O/S , Ventilation , server , storage , networks 
                    2)   Platform as a Service  PAAS – this serves can be use hardware setup and development frame (software services ) and own application 
                    3)   Software as a Service   SAAS –  this service can use over all  hardware as well as software setup with application 
                            
                  
                              

5.	AWS Global Infrastructure Count ?
Availability Zones: AWS had over 80 Availability Zones in 25 geographic Regions around the world. Each Region consists of multiple Availability Zones to provide redundancy and fault tolerance.
Edge Locations: AWS had more than 200 Edge Locations. These Edge Locations are used by the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) to cache and distribute content to end-users with low latency.
Local Zones: AWS introduced Local Zones in some metropolitan areas to provide single-digit millisecond latency to end-users. These Local Zones extend the reach of AWS services to even more locations.


6.	Why do we use region ?
                This design achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability. When you view your resources, you see only the resources that are tied to the AWS Region that you specified.
                 The using region because one region data forwarding  , storage, handling  as well as charges  and many thing and data separating are very easy    


7.	What is service ? & What are resources ?
            Servies – they have intangible good that is produced and consumed simultaneously  and including the many resources in one service 
            Resources – the resources have you can work with the service part for example EC2 instance , creating bucket and multiple resources 





IAM:-


1.	How many resources do we have in IAM ?
        a.	Can be owner can create IAM  user account and they have generate keys and there password 
        b.	In this he will be add to group and  create a group
        c.	They provide the roles 
        d.	And also provide the policies 
       e.	And they have give  services and resources roles and polices
       f.	The own custom polices he give
                -AWS Accounts
               -IAM Users
              -IAM Groups
             - IAM Roles
             -AWS Services and Resources
             -Customer Managed Policies
             -Resource Policies






2.	Deployment model in IAM ?
3.	Identities in IAM ?
4.	What is an IAM User ?


5.	What is the IAM Group ?
        Collection of IAM users and there give the specific permission to group as well attached to user  





6.	What is the IAM Policy ?
7.	Where do we attach Identity Based Policy ?
8.	Where do we attach Resource Based Policy ?
                 IAM polices defines permission for an action of the method that you use to perform the operation to specific services there are tow type of policy 
                      
             •	Identity based policy 
                       Attach managed and inline policies to IAM identification ( user ,group , roles )

                •	Resource based policy 
                         Attache inline policies for resource
                        The most conman example of amazon s3 bucket policies and IAM role trust  policies 

           




9.	What is the IAM Role ?
           To the temporary access to specific services to user you give the use the IAM role   

10.	Can we be able to create Policy via json code ?
           The you wanted attached a policy to the user by json the code will you generate and past the json code bar and attached to the user 




11.	If one user has created it by default, which permission has been assigned to that user ?
12.	What is dominator policy ?





13.	What is ARN ? What are the fields in ARN ? ( amazon resource name ) 
                 ARN is the specific formats depends on the resource to provides  to aws it is 23 digit number and code  
               
                      There are six fields in ARN       
                               Arn name : aws (provides name) : iam (service name) : (region) : (account ID ) : ( resorce ID , name )




14.	How many types of ARN Partition ?
                    There are three types of ARN – 1) aws – AWS regions
                                                   2) aws-cn – china regions 
                                                  3) aws-us-gov – AWS Govcloud (US) regions  




15.	What are Tags ?
        There are use the tags to identification purpose the specific services recourse
        And tags are metadata labels attached to cloud resources to provide additional information about those resources
